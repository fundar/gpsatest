= How it works = 
On setup, Plugin sends an AJAX request to <a href="https://www.usersdelight.com">UsersDelight</a> to save settings (saved locally on wordpress as well) and get a free unique API key. Then, an embedded JS file loads the settings with the given API key 
and shows feedback bar as you configured it.
